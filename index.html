I am currently a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I earned my PhD degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2024. 

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Weakly-supervised machine learning:</b> During my master’s and PhD studies, I focused on developing efficient machine learning algorithms under limited supervision, particularly in areas such as noisy-label learning, partial-label learning, and (partial) multi-label learning.</li>

<li><b>AI safety:</b> Driven by the rapid advancement of large (vision-) language models demployed in real-world tasks, I have become interested in building safe and reliable foundation models, e.g., uncovering and defending against backdoor and jailbreak attacks on vision-language models. </li> 

<li><b>LLM-based agents:</b> Currently, I am dedicated to exploring reinforcement learning techniques for training LLM-based agents deployed in real-world applications, such as <a href="https://github.com/langfengQ/verl-agent">[verl-agent]</a>. My long-term goal is to develop efficient agents capable of robust decision-making in real-world tasks.</li>
</ul>
